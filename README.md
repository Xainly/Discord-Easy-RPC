- Buttons, you can put up to 2 buttons. You better choose them well. Write the name and change the url in your will. You can also put different icon/symbol, etc. to there. (Also you If you click on your button, it doesn't work. But on other's it does. So, don't worry.

- If you want to see the **time left** thingy, go to the https://www.epochconverter.com/ This website updates per second to show you the exact epoch timestamps. Set your time and see it's epoch and copy the first one and paste it back to the endTimeStamp and then you are done with timestamps.
